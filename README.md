# HogAmp: 9V Electric Guitar Amplifier
I made a very simple, portable guitar amplifier. Its based off the LM386N-1 and is designed to run off a single 9V battery. I travel a lot to-and-fro school and bringing my 10W amp, while small, is becoming annoying. Its a bit too big to fit in a backpack and needs mains ac to run. With my amp, these problems are gone in exchange for power and quality. However, for practice, this is not a concern to me. The HogAmp's name is inspired by the Pignose brand of amps. Those are too expensive for me, so here is my compromise!

I bought some extras incase I blew something up. Also, since when was shipping so expensive?! This is the cheapest option. In the future, I will buy bulk components all at once.
